# TicTacToe2

TicTacToe improved. The rules remain mostly he same, only the two players are playing on 9 boards at the same time, and 
the objetive is to fill in a row, column or diagonal of boards. 

Initially you can play on any board, but the next play must occur on the board that has the coordinate of the last marked spot.

It's harder to explain than it is to understand by playing, I promise. 

You can [play it here](https://vbustamante.github.io/TicTacToe2/)
